## Hi there 👋

This is a (hopefully) growing collection of tools, snippets and code I use with my SonnenBatterie 10.

If you want to know more about the company (Sonnen) and their products, follow the respective links:

[Sonnen (German)](https://sonnen.de/)  
[Sonnen (UK)](https://sonnenbatterie.co.uk/)

DISCLAIMER: I am just a Sonnen customer, I own a SonnenBatterie but I'm not affiliated or otherwise related to Sonnen. 
Feel free to contribute or just use the scripts and snippets.
